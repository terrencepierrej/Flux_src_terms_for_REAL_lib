    "The differential equations that `CurviGiRaFFE` evolves are written in conservation form, and thus have two different terms that contribute to the time evolution of any conserved quantity $\\mathcal{C}$, the flux term $\\mathcal{F}$ and the source term $\\mathcal{S}$:\n",

    "We will use a high-resolution shock capturing scheme, which solves the Riemann problem using the HLL approximate Riemann solver to implement the above equation, to ensure that sharp features in our GRFFE fields are properly modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then see that, if we rewrite this, the right-hand side (RHS) describing the time evolution $\\partial_t \\tilde{S}_i$ consists of two terms: the flux term and the source term. The flux term in particular can be tricky, as it may be discontinuous due to sharp features that may appear e.g., at current sheets or inside black hole horizons. If we were to simply approximate the term using finite-difference derivatives, such sharp features would lead to a [Gibbs-like phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon). So, we implement a different algorithm to take the derivative. Further, note that we need not take special care of the Christoffel symbols resulting from the covariant derivative of the flux; we can simply calculate it at the cell-centers along with the source term, thus it is not handled here. In this module we therefore handle\n",

    "There is some additional complexity to consider in generating the C code for these expressions. The flux term we need to add to the RHSs is a finite difference of the fluxes we have calculated so far, so these cannot be simple pointwise operations. However, we also cannot use NRPy+'s build-in finite-differencing tools because of how we store the reconstructed quantities (that is, quantities reconstructed on the $i-1/2$ face is stored at point $i$ in memory), which makes the FD template we need look just like a forward finite-differencing template, which NRPy+ cannot do. So, we must write the code to read and write data from and to memory ourselves. We will do so algorithmically with python string operations, so as to reduce the possibility from human error. \n",

    "We will loop over the interior, but use string replacement to include an extra point in the $+x,y,z$ ghostzones. The finite differences here will be done backwards from what we're used to; while we would normally read from several points and then write to a single point, we will read from a single point and then write to two points. In this particular case, this will reduce the number of times we recalculate things. "

    "This computes phase speeds in the direction given by flux_dirn. Note that we replace the full dispersion relation with a simpler one, which overestimates the maximum speeds by a factor of ~2. See full discussion around Eqs. 49 and 50 in [Duez, et al.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0503420.pdf). In summary, we solve the dispersion relation (in, e.g., the $x$-direction) with a wave vector of $k_\\mu = (-\\omega,k_x,0,0)$. So, we solve the approximate dispersion relation $\\omega_{\\rm cm}^2 = [v_A^2 + c_s^2 (1-v_A^2)]k_{\\rm cm}^2$ for the wave speed $\\omega/k_x$, where the sound speed $c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P/(h \\rho_0)}$, the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_A = 1$ (in GRFFE), $\\omega_{\\rm cm} = -k_\\mu k^\\mu$ is the frequency in the comoving frame, $k_{\\rm cm}^2 = K_\\mu K^\\mu$ is the wavenumber squared in the comoving frame, and $K_\\mu = (g_{\\mu\\nu} + u_\\mu u_\\nu)k^\\nu$ is the part of the wave vector normal to the four-velocity $u^\\mu$.
